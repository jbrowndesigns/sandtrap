## The SandTrap Sports Bar & Grill

### OVERVIEW

My second static website I designed, coded and hosted in late 2019. This website went through two build versions with the first version being "ported" over into a mobile-first build. Then mid 2020, a more modern build was released. 

Link to see the pre-ported version: https://web.archive.org/web/20191205141819/http://thesandtrapsportsbar.com/
  

The goals of this design was to do the following:
- Create a more modern online presence for the client
- Change layout to adjust to the viewport size
- Connect social media to the website
- Offer a menu to easily browse options during social distancing standards
- Provide easier options to order take-out during and after lockdown orders
- Provide contact methods for potential customers to ask for quotes on catering 
- Provide a pop-up to be used for any important announcements or special events

**Languages and Frameworks used:**

HTML, CSS, JQuery, Javascript

**Features of The SandTrap:**
```
- Multi page layout
- JQuery drop down menu
- Contact form
- Pop-up model
```

This was designed with a mobile interface as the primary focus due to 75% traffic being mobile users. Therefore a few divs, which should be marked, have been created and labeled mobile just for that viewport. Important things to note is that the mobile nav does have a separate navigation and css file that is named accordingly.
